"""Census/demographic data for NYC Council districts.

The original version POSTed to councilcount-llm, a Flask service on the council
network (10.250.7.47:5000) that put an LLM in front of a SQL database. That host
is unreachable off-VPN, so this clone uses the public `councilcount` package the
NYC Council publishes on PyPI instead:

    https://pypi.org/project/councilcount/
    https://github.com/NewYorkCityCouncil/councilcount-py

It ships American Community Survey estimates as data files inside the package,
so lookups are local — no network call, no key, nothing to be off-network from.
The trade-off versus the internal service is that there is no LLM translating
the question into SQL, so matching a question to a variable is keyword-based
here (as the internal tool's own variable matching was) and the tool reports
which variable it picked so a wrong guess is visible rather than silent.

Install note: the package pins exact versions of requests, certifi, urllib3,
numpy and pandas. This project leaves those five unpinned so pip can resolve
them from councilcount, which keeps `pip install -r requirements.txt` working
on hosts that allow no extra pip flags.
